<p>
  Lital was born in 29th January 1989, in Israel. since a young age of her life,
  she was very musical. her first instrument was keyboards, on the age of 8. she
  began to play very first compare all others in the class, so she jumped right
  away to the second class of keyboards class. after one year or so, Lital
  wanted to proceed with playing the keyboard so she decided to study piano! she
  took private lessons with a private nice teacher named Lena. Unfortunately,
  Lital's parents couldn't afford these days to buy a real piano, what forces
  Lital to keep on practice piano's melodies on the regular keyboards, but that
  situation effected her very badly and after two years, Lital decided to stop
  taking lessons.

  On the age of 12, Lital decided to learn to play on the guitar. since her
  older brother played the guitar and there was a guitar at her home, she bought
  a chords book and learned alone by herself (and the chords book) playing the
  guitar. Lital felt very connected with the guitar and the process went quite
  well for her. also in those years, the internet developed and Lital was able
  to learn how to read guitar tabs, so she always found a short term of time to
  connect the internet (which caught the regular phone line at home these days)
  and download fast all tabs of each song she was willing to learn to play on
  the guitar.

  When Lital got to high school, she entered to a music class. she already
  learned to play on electric guitar and play solos of many popular bands such
  as Pink Floyd, Beatles, Metallica, Nirvana, Led Zeppelin, etc...she got very
  professional and enjoyed every music class she entered. also Music is the
  highest grade of her high school diploma.

<p>
  In the same days, Lital tried also to entered computers class, but she
  couldn't make it since she felt like her destiny belongs to music only.
</p>

<p>
  After Lital finished high school, she enters to army service, as a Teacher
  Soldier to deaf teenagers which needed help with preparation for
  matriculation. Lital learned the sign language, and that is how she was able
  to communicate with those teenagers.

<p>
  During her military service, one of Lital's best friends,Adir, died in a kit
  surfing accident. The loss was traumatic and difficult for her. One of the
  nights during seven days of the grief, she dreamed of him and the dream led
  Lital to write and compose a song about him. When Lital played the song to
  Adir's parents, they were so excited and it was decided that they were going
  to look for a music producer and a recording studio to make this song happen.
</p>

<p>
  After the music producer with whom the song was produced was found, Lital
  entered the studio with the producer and they started working. At this point
  in Lital's life, she realized what she wanted to do "when she grew up." Lital
  wanted to be a music producer herself, she wanted to learn how to record
  instruments herself, run audio recording software, know how to create good
  sound, know how to mix and, in fact, know how to do everything from scratch.
</p>

<p>
  and so it was! Lital fulfilled her dream as a musician, and to date, has been
  working in the music industry for 14 years. Lital has worked with well-known
  artists from the top ranks of the Israeli music industry: Harel Moyal, Margol,
  Yishai Levy, Tzvika Pick, Zehava Ben, Yishai Rivo, Amir Banyon, Nasrin Kadri,
  Michal Shapira, Shlomo Bar, Itai Levy, Yasmin Levy and many more.

  In 2019 Lital went through a difficult crisis, which caused her deep
  heartache, which led her to non-stop writing and composing 11 songs. This is
  how Little Singularity's first album was born, which will be released on
  August 8, 2023.

  During Lital's musical career, Lital found herself completely by chance,
  entering a job at a small high-tech start-up, which developed a music
  application and was just looking for a musician and sound man. Luckily for
  Little, she was a good fit for the company and that's how Little was exposed
  to the high-tech world for the first time. After a few years as a project
  manager in the same company, Little worked in another company as a project
  manager, while starting to learn Python, Java Script, html and the rest is
  history :)

<p>
  Lital is a rare example of a person who fulfilled her dream and also found her
  love for development. Lital is admittedly only at the beginning of her
  journey, but with perseverance and dedication like she has - the sky is the
  limit, and she will go far :)
